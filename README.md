# basic_clean
a plugin to clean up WP and add a few useful things

some of those things are:

- shortened uploads path
- custom login logo
- custom login url
- page/post views stats
- media downloads stats
- forms via json config
- opengraph meta tags
- cache-control header
- auto xml sitemap
- remove unneeded styles/scripts/tags

shortcodes available:

[lorem]x[/lorem] - show x paragraphs of generated text
[form]name[/form] - embed a form defined in the json config

if you wreck the forms json, type the word "reset" without quotes on its own into the form config field and click save to reset to the default/demo json.
